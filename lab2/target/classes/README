Lab 1 - Setup
==============
1. Go to the tests section. Run them. They should all pass.
2. Change the value from 360 to something wrong. Run the test. Read the message.
3. A line is commented out. Remove the assert and replace it with the Assertions test. Now run the test again, reading the more meaningful error message. Do you understand why Assertions is recommended?
4. Before you proceed do you understand why interfaces are used in coding? Ensure that you do.
5. Add code to the main class to create a new WeddingRepository object using its implementation MockWeddingRepositoryImpl.
   Add code to display the details of wedding RS342. You will have to add the Lombok @ToString to the class level to get
   meaningful output rather than the default which is the address in memory.
6. Add code to create a new CalculateCost object in main() into which the WeddingRepository is wired.
   Demonstrate the incVat and exVat functionality.
